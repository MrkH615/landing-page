# landing-page
Landing page project for The Odin Project, Foundations Path
- Project to make landing page using flexbox based on design specified at https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png and https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/colors_and_stuff.png

## What I learned:
- Using nested flexboxes for layout
- Using git rm to remove unused files from repository
- Using git checkout to fix a layout issued caused by some changes I made
